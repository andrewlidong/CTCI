1. Consider the base assumptions.  
    An 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares.  
    Taking away 2 gives you 62 squares.  
    31 dominoes of 2 squares = 62 squares.  

2. Reduce the problem
    2x2 chessboard = 4 squares
    Cut off 2 squares = 2 squares
    1 domino of 2 squares = 2 squares
    => impossible unless you cut the domino into 2

3. Test that it is impossible for 8x8 chessboard
    Every domino must have two adjacent squares to place on chessboard.  
    Cutting opposite corners deprived two squares of adjacent squares

    If we viewed a chessboard as alternative black and white squares, two black squares or two white squares 

    A domino needs a black square and a white square to occupy the chessboard.
