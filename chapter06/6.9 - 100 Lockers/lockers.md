Q: For which rounds is a door toggled (open or closed)?
A: A door n is toggled once for each factor of n, including itself and 1.  That is, door 15 is toggled on rounds 1, 3, 5 and 15.  

Q: When would a door be left open? 
A: A door is left open if the number of factors is odd.  You can think about this by pairing factors off as an open and a close.  If there's one remaining, the door will be open.  

Q: When would x be odd?
A: The value x is odd if n is a perfect square.  Here's why: pair n's factors by their complements.  If n is 36, the factors are (1,36), (2,18), (3,12), (4,9), (6,6).  Note that (6,6) contributes one factor, thus giving n an odd number of factors.  

Q: How many perfect squares are there? 
A: Tere are 10 perfect squares.  You can count them or you could simply take the numbers 1 through 10 and square them.  

Therefore, there are 10 lockers open at the end of this process.
