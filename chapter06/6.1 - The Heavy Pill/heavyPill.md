1. For one use, you must measure at least 19 bottles.  If one bottle is 1.1 grams then the other 19 will be normal.  

2. For the 19 bottles the one measurement must be done s.t. you can differentiate one bottle from the other bottles.  The basis of measurement is weight

3. To reduce the problem, assume that there are fewer bottles and work through the base cases.  

    1 bottle: If it has pills with 1.1 grams, measure one pill on the scale to confirm.  
    2 bottles: Measure one pill from one bottle on the scale to confirm.  
    3 bottles: Leave out one bottle, measure the pills from the remaining two bottles to confirm.  

4. To differentiate each bottle, vary the number of pills from each bottle.  

    bottle 1: 1 pill
    bottle 2: 2 pills
    bottle 3: 3 pills
        ...
    bottle 19: 19 pills

5. Count the number of pills

6. Measure the entire bunch of pills in one shot

7. Excess weight reveals the bottle with overweight pills.
